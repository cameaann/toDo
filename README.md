## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Vite.js](https://vite.dev/) - React framework
- [pragmatic-drag-and-drop](https://atlassian.design/components/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/about) - Atlassian’s library 'Pragmatic drag and drop'

### What I learned

In this project, it was important for me to work with TypeScript and refine the type definitions. I also aimed to gain experience with a drag-and-drop library. For this purpose, I used the pragmatic-drag-and-drop library, which I was using for the first time. The implementation presented some challenges, so I referred to existing examples to guide my work.


### Continued development
In future projects, I would like to focus on using reducers for managing global state. I also aim to deepen my understanding of advanced TypeScript patterns and improve my skills in performance optimization and code organization within React applications.


### Useful resources

- [Top 5 Drag-and-Drop Libraries for React in 2025](https://puckeditor.com/blog/top-5-drag-and-drop-libraries-for-react) - This article helped me to decide what dnd library to choose for my project.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.example.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
